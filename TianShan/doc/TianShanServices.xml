<!--
Regular procedures of loading configurations:
  1) When a service starts, read HKEY_LM\Softwares\ZQ Interactive\TianShan\Services\<ServiceName>\configDir, if the
     TianShanService.xml is successfully opened, jump to 5)
  2) tries HKEY_LM\Softwares\ZQ Interactive\TianShan\Services\configDir, if the TianShanService.xml is successfully
     opened, jump to 5)
  3) tries the dir ..\etc of where the executable is, if the TianShanService.xml is successfully opened, jump to 5)
  4) puts an error as system event, say no configuration TianShanService.xml can be opened. Quit the program
  5) reads the TianShanService.xml, if there is any XML formatting errors, put an error as system event then quit
     the program
  6) reads the LogFolder in the XML, take it if succeed, otherwise use ..\logs of where the executable is. Open the
     main log file, and immediately put a line including
       a) service name
       b) service version number
       c) the full pathname of TianShanService.xml
     as the first log message in the main logfile
  7) continues to populate other configurations
  8) initialize the service and start serving
