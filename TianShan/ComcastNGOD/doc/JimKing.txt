All,

Attached are a few documents provided as a follow up to our discussion this morning.  Another scope item to consider - in the "DDD" document attached below, Comcast "highly recommends" supporting the D4 and D5 interfaces from the Streaming Server.  We in the Axiom core do not support them but you may want to consider this (at least as a second step) on the video server side.

I will attempt to collect information about the announce messages generated by the NGOD Streaming Server.  I do not have those yet.

Please let me know if you'd like any further information,

Jim

(documents attached)

(1) NGOD-SOW1-support-3-slide4.jpg: a basic diagram showing the connection between various Axiom components and their NGOD counterparts.
(2) NGOD-integration-issues.xls: a collection of issues that have come up during the bi-weekly NGOD/SeaChange (and now Motorola) conference calls
(3) NGOD DDD.doc: Comcast authored document (sometimes referred to as an "implementation guide") for NGOD SOW #1.  Notice that is has specific sections that refer to "SeaChange" (meaning the Axiom software) and other sections referring to Streaming Servers and such.  You may notice the document is a rough edit from a previous document (which we do not have).
