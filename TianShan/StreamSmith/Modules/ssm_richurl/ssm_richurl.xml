		<!--Some client application middleware may not allow to pass the application or transport parameters 
		as TianShan extended header directly. As a solution, those expected parameter such as smardcard-id, 
		ticket-id, are allowed to pass as URL parameters. A plugin called ssm_richurl is introduced to the RTSP 
		server. The plugin fixes up the requests before they are being handled and may fixes up the responses 
		before they are sent to the client. The plugin will have an XML based configuration to identify which 
		type of STB that it need to participant to perform the fixup, for example:-->
		<UserAgent keyword="Enseo" />
