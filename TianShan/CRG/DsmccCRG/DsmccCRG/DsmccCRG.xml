<!--
Notice: TianShanDef.xml has been preloaded when this configuration file is being parsed, please refer to
        TianShanDef.xml for the common properties

Regular procedures of loading configurations:
  1) When a service starts, read HKEY_LM/Softwares/ZQ Interactive/TianShan/Services/<ServiceName>/configDir, load 
     the common properties if the TianShanDef.xml is opened, if <ServiceName>.xml is successfully opened, jump to 5)
  2) tries HKEY_LM/Softwares/ZQ Interactive/TianShan/Services/configDir, load the common properties if the
     TianShanDef.xml is opened, if <ServiceName>.xml is successfully opened, jump to 5)
  3) tries the dir ../etc of where the executable is, load the common properties if the TianShanDef.xml is opened,
     if <ServiceName>.xml is successfully opened, jump to 5)
  4) puts an error as system event, say no configuration TianShanService.xml can be opened. Quit the program
  5) reads the <ServiceName>.xml, if there is any XML formatting errors, put an error as system event then quit
     the program
  6) reads the LogFolder in the XML, take it if succeed, otherwise use ../logs of where the executable is. Open the
     main log file, and immediately put a line including
       a) service name
       b) service version number
       c) the full pathname of <ServiceName>.xml
     as the first log message in the main logfile
  7) continues to populate other configurations
  8) initialize the service and start serving
