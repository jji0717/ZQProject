     ** The names in the xml is sense sensitive
		     attributes:
		       pid             - pid of the content that need to be proactively imported, can not be empty
		       paid            - paid of the content that need to be proactively imported, can not be empty. 
           cluster         - which cluster does this content plan to import. CME will pick one if no cluster specified.
           startTime       - what time does the proactive import suppose to happen. If empty value filled, CME will use current time. 
                             If not empty, It is local time in format of: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, ex: 2014-05-14 08:00:00
           lifeTimeInHours - the hours that content will be kept in storage before deleting since startTime. 
                             If import failed, CME will retry until reaching its life time. 
                             if invalid number filled, CME will take 0 as the life time. 
                             DO NOT SET IT VERY LONG.
