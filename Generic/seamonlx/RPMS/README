Steps that were used to build the xmlrpc-c RPM (xmlrpc-c-1.20.00-00.x86_64.rpm)

On guidev:
## use the tarball had been previously expanded
## this tar file is also checked into AccuRev in Linux-MGTV1.0/seamonlx/rpms/01.20.00.tar.gz
# cd /home/mcatalanotti/xmlrpc-c/01.20.00_build_test/01.20.00
# cd /home/mwoodside/mc_xmlrpc/01.20.00
## run these following 3 steps to build the package and install the files in the correct place
# ./configure --enable-libxml2-backend --enable-tools
# make
# make install

## after the xmlrpc-c has been built and locally installed on guidev then create an RPM with those built files
# cd /home/mwoodside/workspace_mount/builds/mw_Linux-MGTV1.0-int/kits
# ./build-xmlrpc-c-rpm
## copy the file to HPHA2 to install and test
# scp /home/mwoodside/workspace_mount/builds/mw_Linux-MGTV1.0-int/kits/RPMS/x86_64/xmlrpc-c-1.20.00-00.x86_64.rpm root@hpha2:/root

On hpha2:
# cd /root
# rpm -e xmlrpc-c-1.20.00-00
# rpm -ivh xmlrpc-c-1.20.00-00.x86_64.rpm
## build seamonlx against the currently installed xmlrpc-c
# cd /home/mwoodside/workspace_mount/builds/mw_Linux-MGTV1.0-int/seamonlx
# make
# cd /home/mwoodside/workspace_mount/builds/mw_Linux-MGTV1.0-int/seamonlx/src
# cp seamonlx /usr/local/seamonlx/bin
## start the seamonlx that was build against the 1.20.00 installed RPM and test
# ./usr/local/seamonlx/bin/seamonlx -d
# xmlrpc http://hpha2:59732/RPC2 ServerEnv s/Fans
